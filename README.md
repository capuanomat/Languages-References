# Software Engineering Reference
A personal reference of any and all essential things that should be known as a software engineer/developer. This includes things like references on specific programming languages, cheat sheets, etc.

| <b>Branches</b> |
| View all local branches in package | `git branch -l` |
| View all remote branches in a package | `git branch -r` |
| Create branch  | `git branch <branch_name>` |
| Create and checkout branch | `git checkout -b <branch_name>` |
| Delete local branch | `git branch -d <branch_name>` |
| Delete multiple local branches  | `git branch -d <branch1> <branch2> <branch3> <etc.>` |
| Force delete local branch | `git branch -D <branch_name>`   |
| Force delete multiple local branches | `git branch -D <branch1> <branch2> <branch3> <etc.>`   |
| Delete remote branch | `git push origin --delete <branch_name>` |
| Delete multiple remote branches | `git push origin --delete <branch1> <branch2> <etc.>` |
| Fetch a remote branch and locally track it | `git checkout --track [remotename]/[branch]` (`remotename` is usually `origin`) |
| Push local branch to remote first time| `git push -u origin <branch_name>` |
| Push local branch to remote | `git checkout <branch_name>; git push origin <branch_name>` |
| <b>Fixing Issues & Undoing Changes</b> |
| See entire commit history | `git reflog` |
| Undo a commit but keep changes | `git reset HEAD^` |
| Undo git add (remove from commit environment) | `git reset <file_name>`|
| Resetting\* (force undo local commits, can take you to any commit I think) |`git reset --hard HEAD~<num_commits>` |
| Reset HEAD to any past points | `git reset HEAD@{<number,_check_git_reflog_>}` |
| Restore to the previous state of HEAD (\*\*roughly equivalent to `git reset HEAD@{1}` | `git reset ORIG_HEAD` |
