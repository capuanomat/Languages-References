# Languages-References
Personal reference of all programming languages I've studied for ease of access and later review

I'm going to go back and try to add all the non-trivial programs I've written in each of those languages.

# Why do I do this?
You know how sometimes you have to implement a certain feature in your code and you realize "Hmmm, I've implemented this before but I forgot how/where." 
Well that's why. Now if I'm programming in Python and I forgot how I previously used scikit-learn's decision tree algorithm, I don't have
to go back and look through 50 different folders of python assignments I've done. I just come here and tada!
