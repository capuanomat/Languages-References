    /** A NOTE ON QUICKSORT AND MERGE SORT:
     *  Interesting note on quickSort and mergeSort with regards to stability:
     * - http://cafe.elharo.com/programming/java-programming/why-java-util-arrays-uses-two-sorting-algorithms/
     *  Basically, stability doesn't matter for primitive data types because you're not dealing
     *  with pointers, a 6 is the same as a 6 if they're both ints, whereas "6" and "6" may have
     *  different pointers depending on variable name. That's why Arrays.sort uses quickSort for
     *  primitives but mergeSort for objects. Apparently quickSort is faster.

    /* ======= BINARY SEACH =======
    - Binary search only works on sorted arrays
    - Time Complexity: O(log(n) ) because youâ€™re halving your data input on each pass
        - Not useful if the sorted array changes often 'because insertions and deletions are slow'
    - Space Complexity: O(1) because you just need a reference for the lower and upper bound, and current element
