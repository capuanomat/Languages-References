# C++ Quick Notes

### Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference
- Reference: https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~myers/c++/notes/references.html
- ...

### decltype
- decltype is a keyword that allows you to find the type of an expression
- Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decltype
- Reference: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/decltype


### Passing strings into Functions
- Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4475634/c-pass-a-string
- If youâ€™re passing a string into a function, the function header should read in a const std::string& as the type

### Tuples
- Reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tuples-in-c/
- C++ tuples can hold multiple elements (not just 2) of different data types
- They are initialized as arguments in order in which they will be accessed
- Operations on Tuples
    - get(): To access the tuple values and modify them, accepts the index and tuple name as arguments
        - Note that the get() method is in std::
        - You can get by either index or type: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/tuple/get
    - make_tuple(): to assign tuple with values
        - The values passed need to be in the order with the values declared in tuple
`
#include<iostream>
#include<tuple> // for tuple
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    // Declaring tuple
    tuple <char, int, float> geek;
  
    // Assigning values to tuple using make_tuple()
    geek = make_tuple('a', 10, 15.5);
  
    // Printing initial tuple values using get()
    cout << "The initial values of tuple are : ";
    cout << get<0>(geek) << " " << get<1>(geek);
    cout << " " << get<2>(geek) << endl;
  
    // Use of get() to change values of tuple
    get<0>(geek) = 'b';
    get<2>(geek) =  20.5;
  
     // Printing modified tuple values
    cout << "The modified values of tuple are : ";
    cout << get<0>(geek) << " " << get<1>(geek);
    cout << " " << get<2>(geek) << endl;
  
    return 0;
}
`
#### output:
`
The initial values of tuple are : a 10 15.5
The modified values of tuple are : b 10 20.5
`

- tuple_size(): Returns number of elements present in the tuple
tuple <char,int,float> geek(20,'g',17.5);
cout << "The size of tuple is : ";
cout << tuple_size<decltype(geek)>::value << endl;

#### output:
The size of tuple is :
swap(): swaps the elements of the two different tuples
